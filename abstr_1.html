      a Man-Made Man-Made World</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      I am a 'townie'. I tend to be unimpressed by nature. I have never stood 
      in awe before a volcanic eruption but I enjoyed the TV show. I enjoy a fine 
      photograph but only rarely have I marvelled at the beauty of a sunrise. 
      <br>
      For me and the Abstract Realists of this post-modern, 2K world, human invention 
      provides the wow factor - a book, a film, a game, an advert, a song, a magazine, 
      a website, a ticket. All life is here. I swim in a sea of readymade abstractions. 
      I am as likely to learn my morality from a soap opera as from a parent. 
      I am as likely to learn about art from a website as from a teacher.<br>
      <font size="3"><b>Living the Second-Hand Experience</b></font> <br>
      Even my primary experiences take place in a second-hand world. My house 
      was lived in by others before me. My wife had been married before. The water 
      I drink has been drunk already and the stuff I eat has been eaten before.<br>
      We do not need to manufacture, we recycle. We do not need to make our own 
      sound, we sample. Artists do not need to create a first-hand image - for 
      the clip-art generation, direct observation is unnecessary. We do not need 
      to draw or paint, we can collage. We can plunder and plagiarize with increasing 
      impunity. We are unapologetic copyists. We are not individual geniuses, 
      we are part of an infestation. We are parasites of rejuvenilia. <br>
      <font size="3"><b>WYSIWYF</b> </font><br>
      The Abstract Realist lives through the creativity of others. We feel what 
      others before us have felt.</font><font size="2"> <br>

        Abstract Realism is an Art Movement for the twenty-first century and it 
        is nothing that has not been done in the twentieth. It's got balls and 
        it's a load of bollocks. It says too much and says nothing at all. It 
        is Post Post-Modern. Abstract Realism is a movement of multiple manifestos.<br>
