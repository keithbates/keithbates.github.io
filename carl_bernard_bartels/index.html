      Ask anyone old enough to know a bit of local history, &#8220;Who created 
      the Liver Birds?&#8221; and there&#8217;ll be shoulder shrugs, head-scratching, 
      and answers like, &#8220;I must have sagged school that day&#8221;.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, even if you&#8217;d been a 100% attender at the Dixie Dean Primary, 
      you still wouldn&#8217;t have been able to find out. Not a chance, because 
      the artist who crowned the Royal Liver Building, and gave three-dimensional 
      form to Liverpool&#8217;s world famous symbol has been forgotten for the 
      best part of a century.<br>
      <br>
      And what really sticks in one&#8217;s craw is finding out that this monumental 
      omission regarding something as Liverpudlian as a lolly-ice, is not just 
      some absent-minded, half-cocked, art historical oversight. This gaping hole 
      in Liverpool&#8217;s collective consciousness was connived, coldly calculated 
      by the very custodians charged with the stewardship of that knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      In 1887, a 21 year old wood carver from Stuttgart, Carl Bernard Bartels, 
      came to Britain on his honeymoon. He fell in love with England and decided 
      to make his home here.<br><br>
      In the early years of the twentieth century, living and working in Harringay, 
      London, Carl Bernard entered and won a competition to design Liver Birds 
      for the top of Walter Aubrey Thomas&#8217;s Liver Building, groundbreaking 
      in its use of reinforced concrete.<br>
      <br>
      Ask the Art institutions of Britain, as I have done recently, &#8220;Who 
      created the Liver Birds?&#8221;, and they&#8217;ll refer to the standard 
      repository, Terry Cavanagh&#8217;s Public Sculpture of Liverpool. The trouble 
      is that Terry, like the rest of us, is a victim of historical filtering 
      and pilfering when he states that the Liver Birds were made by George Cowper 
      and the Bromsgrove Guild. Stricly speaking he&#8217;s not wrong, only a 
      foundry with a dedicated team of craftsmen like the Bromsgrove Guild could 
      make metal sculptures the size of a double-decker bus. The Guild, which 
      closed in 1966, made the gates of Buckingham Palace.<br>
      <br>
      But that&#8217;s not the point, is it? Who actually conceived, designed 
      and carved the Liver Bird? Who was the artist?<br>
      <br>
      Well, not only was I not told, but no-one at my old school knew, because 
      all records of Carl Bernard&#8217;s achievements were purposefully and systematically 
      destroyed. And why? Because we were at war with Germany, and how embarrassing 
      to have your city&#8217;s symbol created by one of &#8216;them&#8217;. Even 
      if the supposed enemy had been a naturalised British citizen, resident here 
      for twenty years!<br>
      <br>
      The guardians of our City effectively erased all mention of Carl Bernard 
      Bartels. And the sorry saga goes from bad to worse, for not only did the 
      the British authorities imprison Bartels in an internment camp on the Isle 
      of Man, he was also, when war was over, forcibly repatriated to Germany, 
      leaving behind his wife and children in England.<br>
      <br>
      In the late 1990s, some descendants of Carl Bernard made a pilgrimage to 
      Liverpool. Tim Olden, great grandson of the artist, met with city representatives 
      in an effort to begin a process of rediscovery and long overdue recognition.<br>
      <br>
      Historical and architectural websites are at last starting to mention Bartels&#8217; 
      contribution. And the momentum gathered pace with the intention of restoring Bartels&#8217; 
      good name and place in history in time for the &#8216;08 celebrations.<br>
      <br>
      Until recently, no photograph of Carl Bernard could be found in books or 
      on the internet. In 2003, Liverpool writer Tom Slemen posted a request for 
      information on the Bartels page of the website Genealogy.com, but to no 
      avail.<br>
      <br>
      Then, in August 2005, Bartels's great grandson, Tim Olden, was surfing the web looking for references 
      to his great grandfather, and found himself looking at Gerry Jones&#8217;s 
      <a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/gerry.jones/lyver3hist.html"><font color="#666666">Third 
      Lyver Bird</font></a> website. Gerry, who had just updated his site with 
      a few snippets of information which I&#8217;d sent him about Carl Bernard, 
      was made up to receive an email from Tim which included two photographs 
      of the elusive Mr. Bartels. At last, there was the face behind the legend.<br>
      <br>
      The Third Lyver Bird site also contains other details that help flesh out 
      the Bartels story. Gerry mentions that three quarters of Liverpool butchers 
      were of German extraction prior to World War One. At the end of the war 
      the figure was zero, hiding a multitude of xenophobic injustices.<br>
      <br>
      I can recall my father, years ago, telling me the tale of a butcher in Garston, 
      a real gentleman, who became the victim of race hatred, yet such uncomfortable 
      memories risk being lost, precisely at the time we need to treasure them 
      most.<br>
      <br>
      In these days when the threat of terrorism might tend to colour the way 
      we view our neighbour, and with the tragic death of Anthony Walker 
      touching everyone, isn&#8217;t it worth reminding ourselves that all our 
      families have been immigrants at one time or another?<br>
      <br>
      The tale of Carl Bernard Bartels needs to be told, because it is actually 
      one of hope and inspiration. For despite the shameful treatment he received, 
      he demonstrated great forgiveness and fought to return to his adopted country. 
      He lived and worked here until his death in 1955, producing carvings for 
      Durham Cathedral, various stately homes and even making artificial limbs 
      during World War Two.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Righting the Wrong</em>
      <br>
      In July 2011, a hundred years after the Royal Liver Building opened, the City awarded Bartels a posthumous ‘Citizen of Honour’ award, Bartels’s great grandson Tim Olden accepted the award during a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 19 July 2011.
